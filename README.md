A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project. This is a project made for a Coffee Shop where you can find locations and ordre tables, and we have used this project many times throughout our first year of study.


This project is about a site which is called Rainy Days, the point of it was to make this site using HTML and CSS, and later we also used JS to get the content to the site using WordPress REST API and the plugin called WooCommerce.

How I made the site:

Design the website in Adobe XD.
Adobe XD prototype.
Create the website with HTML and CSS
Later on using JS to get more content to the site.
Create a WordPress installation and use its plugin WooCommerce to get the products.
